## Deployment

### Manual Deployment

Jekyll generates your static site to the **_site** directory by default. You can transfer the contents of this directory to almost any hosting provider to get your site live.

### Netlify

This theme is prepared to be hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). All you need to do is create a new private repository on GitHub or GitLab. Upload the theme to the repository and link your repo to Netlify. Please check [this link](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/#step-2-link-to-your-github) with the step by step guidelines.

### Amazon S3

If you want to host your site on Amazon S3, you can do so by using the [s3_website application](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website). It will push your site to Amazon S3 where it can be served like any web server, dynamically scaling to almost unlimited traffic.

Also, please check the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
